## How to build

<!-- [TO FIX]
The `srrg2_solver` is developed using our `srrg2` framework.
All our software is tested both with Ubuntu 18.04 and 16.04 (GCC 5 and 7), still the remaining of this guide refers to Ubuntu 18.04.
Please follow this guide to build and run `srrg2_solver` on your machine:

1. initialize the `srrg2` Catkin workspace following the guide [here](https://github.com/srrg-sapienza/srrg2_core/tree/master/srrg2_core). As indicated in the aforementioned guide, we suggest to have a directory in which you clone all the `srrg2` repositories (referred here as `SRRG2_SOURCE_ROOT`) and a directory that contains the Catkin workspace (referred here as `SRRG2_WS_ROOT`)

2. clone all the `srrg2` dependencies of this package
```bash
cd <SRRG2_SOURCE_ROOT>
git clone https://github.com/srrg-sapienza/srrg2_cmake_modules.git # basic cmake-modules
git clone https://github.com/srrg-sapienza/srrg2_core.git # core data-structures and utilities
```

3. clone this repository
```bash
cd <SRRG2_SOURCE_ROOT>
git clone https://github.com/srrg-sapienza/srrg2_solver.git
```

4. link all the required packages in your Catkin workspace
```bash
cd <SRRG2_WS_ROOT>/src
ln -s <SRRG2_SOURCE_ROOT>/srrg2_cmake_modules .
ln -s <SRRG2_SOURCE_ROOT>/srrg2_core/srrg2_core .
ln -s <SRRG2_SOURCE_ROOT>/srrg2_solver/srrg2_solver .
```

5. build using Catkin
```bash
cd <SRRG2_WS_ROOT>
catkin build srrg2_solver
```

6. [OPTIONAL] build unit-tests using catkin
```bash
cd <SRRG2_WS_ROOT>
catkin build srrg2_solver --catkin-make-args tests
``` -->
